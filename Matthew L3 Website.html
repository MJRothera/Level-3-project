<h2>How to create a website about yourself</h2>
<p>Welcome to my Digital Technology website. On this website, I will tell you how to create your first website about yourself. I chose to create a website about creating your first website, to educate people on how to get started with HTML/CSS. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. The complex technique I am thinking of editing into my website is parallax. Parallax is a scrolling effect for websites.</p>

<h1>What is HTML/CSS?</h1>
    
<p>HTML/CSS is the standard language for documents that are designed to be displayed in a web browser. CSS is the design part of web design. </p>

The second language websites can be written in is Java script. After downloading the HTML software, you will be good to start creating your first  HTML site! To define that is it HTML you need to start with the DOCTYPE HTML command. This defines the file. The tile is where you introduce what the site is going to be about. After you create a title you will need do to the styling for the body. This includes, paragraph colour, heading colour, and the nav or list hover colour. According to Nielson Norman Group, a home page on a website is the most valuable real estate in the world. Having a nav bar on your website is important in order for people to navigate easily around the website. </p>
